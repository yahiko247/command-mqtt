mosquitto -c (directory of the test.config) -v



How to Fix This
1. Check for Processes Using Port 1883

Run the following command to identify what is using the port:

sudo netstat -tuln | grep :1883

Or, using lsof:

sudo lsof -i :1883

This will show the process ID (PID) of the program using port 1883.
2. Kill the Conflicting Process

If you find another process using the port and it's unnecessary, terminate it:

sudo kill <PID>

Replace <PID> with the actual process ID from the output.
3. Restart Mosquitto

After terminating the conflicting process, restart Mosquitto:

mosquitto -c /home/ceowtoo/Documents/config/config.txt -v





the error Operation not permitted when trying to kill a process typically indicates a permissions issue. Since the mosquitto process is running under a different user or as a system service, you need elevated privileges to terminate it.

Hereâ€™s how to proceed:
1. Use sudo to Kill the Process

Run the kill command with sudo:

sudo kill 8803
